Paper: Decomposition Functions for Interconnected Mixed Monotone Systems

Authors: Matthew Abate and Samuel Coogan

Submitted to: IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS), 2021.

Description: Potting_script.m generates Figure 4 in the paper.  A decompositon function for the spacecraft system is constructed from decomposition functions for its subsystems. Over approximations of reachable sets are then computed using mixed monotone systems theory.

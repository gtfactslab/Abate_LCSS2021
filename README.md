Paper: Decomposition Functions for Interconnected Mixed Monotone Systems

Authors: Matthew Abate and Samuel Coogan

Submitted to: IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS), 2021.

Description: Fig_3.m generates Figure 3 in the paper: A tight decomposition function for the kinematic unicycle model is formed by applying Theorem 2, and a hyperrectangular approximation of the systems reachable set is computed by applying Proposition 1. Fig_6.m generates Figure 6 in the paper: We consider a 7-dimensional nonlinear spacecraft model and we compute two approximations of the systems reachable set by applying Corolary 1 with two different system represenations.
